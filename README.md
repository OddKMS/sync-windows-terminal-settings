# Windows Terminal settings sync via OneDrive

Scripts for syncing your settings via "the cloud" until Microsoft
implements this via the Windows Account.

## How to use:

Run `upload-windows-terminal-settings.bat` on the computer you want to sync the settings from.

Then, run `download-windows-terminal-settings.bat` on the computer(s) you want to sync the settings _to_. If Windows Terminal is running it will be closed and re-opened. NB! This _will_ delete your local settings!

Easy peasy!
